# Introduction

Dynamo League is a fantasy football league based off the Yahoo fantasy football league with heavily customized rule sets.
It is comprised of two separate stand-alone applications - a client UI written using Blazor WebAssembly and an API server written using ASP.NET Core.

# Getting Started

Running & contributing to Dynamo League Blazor requires the following:

- .NET 6 SDK
- IIS Express
- SQL Server LocalDB

The latter two are installed automatically with either Visual Studio or Rider.

By default, a test account is created with administrator permissions with the following login information:

Username `test@gmail.com`

Password `hunter2`
