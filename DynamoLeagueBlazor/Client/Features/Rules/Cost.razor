    League dues are $100 in the first year, incrementing by $5 each even year after the first year. Every even year the cap space will increase. See the chart below for reference.
    Dues <b>must</b> be paid by January 1st each season. If an owner does not pay by one week before the season, that owner will be removed from the league.
