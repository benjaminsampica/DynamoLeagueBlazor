<MudExpansionPanel Text="Fines">
    Owning a player that receives a fine, will result in the owner(s) receiving a fine based on the players contract value. The fines start a $1 and
    increment by $1 dollar for each $50 in contract value with a maximum fine of $6. Fines must be called out by other owners and will be paid at the end
    of the season. If the NFL reverses their decision, the commissioner will pay the owner(s) back the fine amount. Attempting to make a trade or waiver claim
    that is invalid will result in a blocked claim/trade and a $5 fine.
